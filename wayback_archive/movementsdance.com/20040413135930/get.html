  An extraordinary event and journey of self-discovery that won&rsquo;t soon be forgotten. Youth, ages 12-22, are brought together in exploration of their roots, their interests, their future and the world around them. Throughout the two weeks, they will meet, enjoy, and develop relationships with others. <br>
                        <br>
                        The festival consists of four basic events:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Two-week long motivational presentations</li>
                        <li><em><strong>Edmonton's Rising Star</strong></em> - Talent Competition</li>

                        <li> Saturday Evening &quot;Jam&quot; </li>
                      </ul>                      <p class="mainbody">The educational and entertaining activities will benefit their physical, mental, social and emotional well-being. The festival will heighten the awareness of our rich Black History and showcase the future leaders of tomorrow. <br>

                          <em><strong>History:</strong></em><br>
                          Founded in 1926, Negro History Week is celebrated annually around the world. In 1976, it became known as the International Black History Month Festival. <span class="company">Movements</span> was founded on February 11, 1990, the day former President Nelson Mandela was released from prison. <span class="company">Movements</span> makes indelible contributions to the City of Edmonton with its dance theatre productions that celebrate this auspicious Festival on a yearly basis. Some of our highlights include <em><strong>Remembering Amber Valley, From Then to Now &ndash; Take Me Back Africa, and A Tribute to Mandela.</strong></em></p>
                      <p class="mainbody"><strong>G.E.T FEST</strong> is organized and supported by cultural, community, government and corporate organizations. <span class="company">Movements</span> partnered with Edmonton schools and education community to bring a series of speakers and workshops. In keeping with our mandate to educate the young and embrace Canada&rsquo;s rich multicultural diversity, <span class="company">Movements</span> feels aptly suited to produce the first Annual Youth festival. This inspiring initiative gives <span class="company">Movements</span> the opportunity to form new and lasting partnerships within the community, as we <em><strong>Get Edmonton Together - one youth at a time. </strong></em></p>
