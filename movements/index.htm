African President Nelson Mandela</span> was freed from prison &#8211;
                    Movements has strived to be an all-inclusive multicultural company. We
                    have built our reputation on the same foundation of strength and hope
                    shared by Mandela himself.</p>

                    youth and community at large and has been recognized by its inspiration Mandela. In his missive to
                    the company, former South African President Nelson Mandela wrote &quot;...yours is truly a noble
                    cause.&quot; </p>
